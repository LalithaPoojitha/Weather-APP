# Weather-APP
## App Overview:

A Weather App is a web application that provides current weather conditions and forecasts for a specific location. The app can display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related data.

## Features:

- Location Search: Users can search for weather data by city or zip code.
- Current Weather: Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Forecast: Displays a 5-day or 10-day forecast with predicted weather conditions.
- Weather Icons: Uses icons to represent different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

## Technologies Used:

- HTML: For creating the app's layout and structure.
- CSS: For styling the app's layout and adding visual effects.
- JavaScript: For handling user input, fetching weather data from APIs, and updating the app's UI.
- API: Uses a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) to fetch weather data.

## How it Works:

1. User Input: Users enter a city or zip code to search for weather data.
2. API Request: The app sends a request to the weather API with the user's location.
3. Data Retrieval: The API returns weather data, which is then parsed and displayed in the app.
4. UI Update: The app updates the UI with the current weather conditions and forecast.

## Conclusion:

Creating a Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great project for learning about web development and APIs. With this app, you can practice working with APIs, handling user input, and updating the UI dynamically.
